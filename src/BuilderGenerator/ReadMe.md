# am4u.BuilderGenerator #

You've just installed a fork of BuilderGenerator, a .NET Source Generator that is designed to add fluent builder classes to your projects. 

## What are Builders?
[Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) are an object creation pattern, similar to the [Object Mother](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) pattern. Object Mothers and Builders are most commonly used to create objects for testing, but they can be used anywhere you want "canned" objects. 

## Examples and Documentation
For documentation, please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/am4u/BuilderGenerator2).
